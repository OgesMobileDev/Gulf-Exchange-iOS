 "compliance"  = "GULF EXCHANGE is one of the premier Exchange House in the State of Qatar established in 1977
    and licensed by The Qatar Central Bank under License No: MS 2/82. \n\n As per the Law No: 36, of 1995 regulating the exchange
    activities, the company is permitted by the Qatar Central Bank to carry out exchange activities like remittances including
    foreign currency, electronic global funds transfers, buying and selling banknotes and gold bullion. The Board of Director of
    Gulf Exchange has appointed a Compliance Manager completed with an experienced &amp; specialized team who is responsible for

    Solutions, like “World-Check”, most comprehensive Sanctions and Politically Exposed Persons database for sanction screening,
    single-source lookup tool like “Word-Check Online. \n\n What Is Money Laundering \n\n The concealment or disguise of
    the true nature, source, locations, disposition, movement ownership of or rights with respect to funds by any person who
    knows, should have known or suspects that such funds are the proceeds of crime. There are three stages to Money Laundering:
    Placement, Layering, and Integration \n\n 1. Objectives and Purpose \n\n Having perused decree Law, no 4 of 2010 on
    Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing and the circular issued by Qatar Central Bank dated June 15, 2010, with regard
    to regulations governing Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Terrorist Financing for Financial Institutions, Gulf Exchange has
    decided to issue this policies and procedures. \n\n Gulf Exchange is based on a clear and explicit policy to control all of the
    financial operations whereby a clear plan is placed in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism based on
    the instructions of Qatar Central Bank, local law as we as international law and standards like Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
    recommendation and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), United Nations, European Union and many others. \n\n To protect Gulf
    Exchange from being a mediator in the money laundering and financing of terrorism or any other illicit activities. \n\n To confirm
    that Gulf Exchange is working on a clear policy for prevention, detection, controlling and reporting of money laundering and
    terrorist financing, in accordance with FATF recommendations. \n\n 2. Know Your Customer – KYC \n\n KYC POLICY is one
    of the most important regulatory requirements in Gulf Exchange’s day-to-day business practices at QCB instruction. It is therefore
    compulsory to know the regular as well as walk-in customers who conduct their personal or business transactions involving money
    with Gulf Exchange. The identity of the customer (an individual or company) must be verified before accepting any transactions for
    any amount. \n\n 3. CDD (Customer Due Diligence) – EDD (Enhanced Due Diligence) \n\n Customer Due diligence is describing
    the processes and procedures used by a business to qualify a potential customer before the establishment of a working relationship
    and is also used to continue qualifying that relationship once it is established. \n\n Enhanced Due Diligence is to take additional
    measures, besides usual Customer Due Diligence, to know more about a customer and to confirm that his/her transactions and funds
    are legitimate and free from any criminal link. We at Gulf Exchange follow the CDD &amp; EDD procedure in order to mitigate,
    detect and report any ML &amp; TF associated risks. \n\n 4. Risk-based Approach \n\n Risk-based Approach is one of the processes
    that is being followed in Gulf Exchange and it’s a methodology that allows to priorities activities based on a previous analysis
    of data and identifies potential high risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and develops strategies to mitigate them.
    Existing obligations, such as client identification, will be maintained as a minimum baseline requirement. \n\n 5. Staff Training \n\n
    Anti-Money Laundering Training is intended to familiarize employees with the process of money laundering and the laws that make it
    a crime. All staff of Gulf Exchange including senior management and board of director attends AML/CFT training, and that’s will
    help the company to develop good corporate governance within the Organization. \n\n 6. Record Keeping \n\n All records including,
    customer’s identification documents and related data, transaction data, and any other related documents must be maintained and
    retained for a minimum period of ten (10) years from the date of financial transactions,Including Internal / external
    reporting of unusual /potentially suspicious transaction and retaining relevant training materials used and staff attendance
    documents. \n\n 7. Privacy/Confidentiality \n\n It is Gulf Exchange’s responsibility to protect the confidentiality of
    all customer transactions including any important and sensitive information, personal business and financial transactions
    information that has been obtained from customers as part of Gulf Exchange’s customer due-diligence practices.";
